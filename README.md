* Type `help oned' for selecting one dimensional basis
* Type 'help FTT' for examples of building FTT. 
    * An additional example can be found in 'test_cases/test1_ftt_basis.m'
* Type 'help SIRT' for examples of building SIRT. 
    * Additional examples can be found in 'test_cases/test_sirt_OU'

Todo list: 
* Implement (or interface with) the DIRT class
* Implement an additional SIRT example.
* Implement DIRT examples on double banana.
